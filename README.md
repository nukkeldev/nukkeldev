> Currently working on [aside](https://github.com/nukkeldev/aside) to experiment with using AI as a pair programmer to getting working MVPs of programs quickly (that I can later improve myself).
> [garden](https://github.com/nukkeldev/garden) is currently on hiatus until I get motivation to work on it again as I need to do a backend rendering rewrite from SDL3GPU to NRI (which is _a lot_ of work).

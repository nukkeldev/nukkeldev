# Introduction
Hello! My name, or psuedonym I guess, is `Nukkel`. A `16-year-old` developer from the US.

I have been programming for `6 years` and am currently interested in a variety of topics (see my pins) mostly oriented towards lower-level programming. Additionally, I am one of the programming leads for FRC 2046.
The majority of my development happens in Rust, consequentially the programming language I am most experienced with, but I choose the best fitting toolset for a project regardless of language.

I have heavy interest in:
- Compilers and Programming Language Development
- GPU-related Programming (primarily with wgpu)
- Data Compression
- Robotics
- Performance

I have minor interest in:
- Distributed Systems
- AI (I don't know enough to specify further)

## What am I working on right now (02/23/24)?
Right now I am working on `mdns-impl`. An implementation and exploration of the mdns/dns-sd protocol in pure rust to get more familiar with implementing specifications, creating libraries, and unit testing.
This is a precursor for another project I am working on `lanp2p2`, a rewrite of a P2P TUI chat client I wrote prior last year. I am focused on learning as many new things as I can right now so I can familiarize
myself with common practices in larger scale projects.
